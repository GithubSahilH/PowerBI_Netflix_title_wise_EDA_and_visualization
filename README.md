# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis - EDA and Visualization

## Overview

This project offers an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of Netflix Movies and TV Shows. Using Power BI, I have crafted an interactive dashboard that allows users to dive into the data and uncover patterns related to directors, countries, ratings, duration, release dates, and content type.

## Key Features

- **Director Influence**: Investigate how different directors contribute to Netflix content.
- **Country Production Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of content based on the countries of origin.
- **Rating Distribution**: Explore how ratings (like PG, R, etc.) correlate with the target audience and content type.
- **Duration Trends**: Examine how the duration of movies and TV shows varies across different genres and time periods.
- **Release Date Insights**: Discover trends and patterns in content release dates.
- **Content Type Comparison**: Compare TV Shows and Movies to see how they differ in terms of production and audience engagement.

## Dashboard

The interactive Power BI dashboard is designed to help users explore the data intuitively. You can filter by director, country, rating, duration, release date, and content type to see how these factors contribute to the overall trends on Netflix.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from a publicly available dataset on Netflix Movies and TV Shows, which includes detailed information about each title.


## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of data visualization in uncovering insights from streaming content. By analyzing various factors like directors, countries, ratings, and content type, we can better understand the dynamics of Netflix's content library.
